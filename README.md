## About 

InAFlash is a clone of the photo-sharing website 500px. InAFlash allows users to log in, sign up or have a demo account sign in, while storing user information in a PostgreSQL database. On InAFlash homepage, users can search up any photo or user information that they'd like using the search bar. There is also a photo of the week feature, which users or visitors can click on in order to generate a photo that has had the most likes of that week. Once users log in or create an account, the user can then upload a photo, with a title, description and privacy setting -- which will set the photo to either be public and be viewed by other users, or private. A user can have an album of photos that they can share, and will have a home-feed that populates with pictures. Users can also follow other users, as well as comment and like other photos. 

I used a wide variety of technologies in order to create this website. For the backend, I used Ruby on Rails with Active Record. I also used PosgreSQL for storing data in the database along with Amazon AWS s3 for storing all the images. For the frontend portion of the project, I used React Redux along with Node.js in order to create a dynamic application.
